# Ng2Slider

A rewrite of [angularjs-slider](https://github.com/angular-slider/angularjs-slider) for Angular 5+.

Work still in progress, but results are encouraging.

Basic slider functionality is working as of v0.1.0.

NPM package is available as of v0.3.0.

## TODO
 * unit tests
 * documentation
 * refactoring
   - look into getting rid of JqLiteWrapper in favour of bindings in sub-components
   - look into moving parts of code into separate classes to make the codebase more manageable
